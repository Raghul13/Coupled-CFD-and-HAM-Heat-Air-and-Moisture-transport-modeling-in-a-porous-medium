# Coupled-CFD-and-HAM-Heat-Air-and-Moisture-transport-modeling-in-a-porous-medium
Development of a numerical model to characterize the coupled energy and mass transfer occur during the process of drying a freshly sliced eggplant (porous media). Energy is introduced to the porous medium by a high-temperature laminar flow(air) and is transferred to either through the mechanism of evaporation of liquid water or the increase of internal energy of the eggplant. The initial mass fraction of liquid water within the eggplant is diffused from the bulk volume to the exposed exterior surfaces of the medium where evaporative phase change facilitates the diffusion of water vapor into the flow of comparatively dry air.  The numerical solution uses the finite volume method with fully implicit scheme for the discretization of 2-Dimensional transient heat and moisture transfer governing equations which are then solved in MATLAB by an iterative process.
